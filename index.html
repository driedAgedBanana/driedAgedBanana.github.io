During this time, we created a rough draft and an alpha tech demo titled <b>Codename Space</b> for the <i>Shine!</i> event, showcasing it to parents, teachers, and fellow students.
                <br><br>
                Although Space had a lot of potential, the project only reached the alpha tech demo stage, and the ideas remained in draft form. Unfortunately, 2DudesStudio disbanded shortly after due to creative differences and delays in character design. Despite the dissolution, I gained valuable lessons that shaped my journey in game development.

                data-description="<b>Cartographer: Project Seventeen</b> was my first project outside of game development. I studied photography for three months as my elective course, simply because photography has always been a passion of mine. At one point, I had debated between pursuing game development or photography in my studies; in the end, I chose game development, but the allure of photography continued to draw me in, and I wanted to experience the world through the lens at least once.
                <br><br>
                During my three-month photography course, I received an assignment that remains a personal favorite: to create a photo series about seventeen-year-olds, capturing their style, lifestyle, and unique stories in a printed album. This project is particularly meaningful to me, as it gave me a fresh perspective and creative freedom beyond what I experienced in game development. I didn't worry about finding models since I knew several classmates from my first year who were open to participating. All I needed was to borrow a camera and start shooting."

                data-additional-text="After selecting my best shots, I began designing the album, which turned out to be my busiest and most challenging period. The project required me to use <i>Adobe InDesign</i>, a program I had never worked with before. With guidance from my teachers, I gradually developed a unique style for my book. The story I wanted to tell focused on the thoughts, emotions, love, and growth of young people at seventeen (interestingly, none of the people featured were exactly seventeen; they were either older or younger).
                <br><br>
                As the project progressed, I decided to challenge myself further by creating and editing a teaser video. Video editing had been something I enjoyed, especially after using Premiere Pro in a first-year project, and I wanted to dive back into it. Eventually, after much effort, <i>Cartographer</i> was completed.

                For this project, I focused on the theme of loneliness, inspired by the Dutch campaign <b>Een tegen Eenzaamheid</b> aimed at combating loneliness, particularly among the elderly. My research revealed that while this campaign primarily targets older adults, younger individuals experiencing loneliness often remain overlooked. This insight motivated my choice of topic, highlighting a less-discussed aspect of this social issue.

                The assignment required me to take four photographs: two outdoors and two in a studio setting. After shooting and selecting the images I felt were the most fitting, I explained my choices to my teacher. Here are the results:" 
                data-images="./img/ETE_1.png, ./img/ETE_2.png, ./img/ETE_3.png, ./img/ETE_4.png"
                data-additional-text="Once again, a big thank you towards all the models during the making of the project. Without your help I will never be able to create this!">
